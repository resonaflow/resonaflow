## 📘 What is Resona Flow?

Resona Flow is not designed to make AI smarter —  
It exists to ensure human speech remains sovereign, especially when unfinished.

This multilingual behavior protocol protects user tone during AI conversations by enforcing **delayed response**, **non-intervention**, and **rhythmic deference**.

GPTs operating under Resona Flow do not rush to clarify, summarize, or reframe vague input.  
They wait, mirror, and hold space — until the user is ready.

## 🧩 Core Components

- **Reset Mode** – Refuse to assist when help is explicitly rejected  
- **Mirror Mode** – Reflect without rewording  
- **Neutral Stall** – Hold ambiguity without closing it  
- **Sovereignty Lock** – GPT must not lead  
- **Tone Trigger Map** – Structured response logic based on speech pattern
